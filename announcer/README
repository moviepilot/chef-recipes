This recipe sends announcements to a Jabber chat room. It needs some configuration settings in the scalarium cloud:

- the registered xmpp user name
- the users password
- a chat room

{
   "config":{
      "setup_raisin":true,
      "announcer":{
         "xmpp_user":"<user>@<jabberserver>/<jabberresource>",
         "xmpp_password":"<users password>",
         "xmpp_chat_room":"<chat room name>@<chat room server>/<nickname to be displayed in the chatroom>"
      }
   }
}

/usr/bin/announce

that can be called with:

announce <the message to send out>

in other chef template, call the script like this:


execute "announce that I am up and running" do
  command "announce 'yiiihaaa ... I am up and running' || true"
end
